# Healthcare Risk Prediction

This project analyzes synthetic electronic health records (EHR) to predict the likelihood of chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension. It includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning models like logistic regression and decision trees.

## Project Goals
- Identify key risk factors for chronic diseases
- Build a predictive model using Python
- Visualize patient risk levels with charts and dashboards

## Tools Used
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Tableau / Streamlit (optional)
- Synthetic EHR dataset (e.g., UCI Diabetes, Heart Disease datasets)

## Structure
- `notebooks/EDA.ipynb`: Exploratory data analysis
- `notebooks/modeling.ipynb`: Model training and evaluation
